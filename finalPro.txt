In order to use this program, enter finalPro() into the command window. A message box will appear with
general instructions for user input. It indicates that inputs must take the form ax^2 + bx + c = d and 
that "a" cannot be zero. Then, the user will get four consecutive input boxes for them to provide the 
a b c and d coefficients. Once done, a figure window with four buttons will appear. The bottom left button
will solve the equation for its roots and display them. The bottom right button will plot the function and
its derivatives on the existing coordinate axis. The top right button will open a new window which will
first display the integral in a message box and also plot the integral. Once this is escaped, the user will 
return to the main figure window. The top left button will escape all ui windows.
